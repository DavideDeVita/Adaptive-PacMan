This directory, contains the source code of the Adaptive PacMan I designed for my Master's degree dissertation

There are 2 different adaptive games:

  >Adaptive Tabular (Adaptive T): which evaluates the current setup aggressivity based on Reinforcement Learning training
  >Adaptive Stateless Behaviours' Score (Adaptive SBS): which evaluates the current setup aggressivity based on hybrid written scores

The controllable features for the adaptive system are hyperparameters (such as Speed, Powerup duration, ...) and alternative behaviours for the NPCs (Blinky/Pinky/Inky/Clyde Chase/Scatter module, ...)

I will also attach the dissertation itself because, well why not? I spent months writing it and it deserves a bit of spotlight too!
